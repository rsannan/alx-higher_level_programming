How to Use 2-matrix_divided.py
==============================

This module defines a division function ``matrix_divided(matrix, div)``.

Using ``matrix_divided``
--------------------

>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Create a matrix.
>>> matrix = [
...    [1, 2, 3],
...    [4, 5, 6]
... ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

This function works with div being a float.

>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3.0))
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

There is no typecasting involved output would reflect div.

>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3.5))
[[0.29, 0.57, 0.86], [1.14, 1.43, 1.71]]

Error Conditions
----------------

``matrix_divided(matrix, div)`` in any case expects a 2D list of numbers and a non_zero number.
When matrix is not a 2D list a TypeError is raised

>>> matrix = [2, 3, 4]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

>>> matrix = ([2, 3, 4])
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

When row in matrix are not the same size a TypeError is raised.

>>> matrix =  [
...    [1, 2, 3],
...    [4, 5]
... ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

When non-number value in matrix a TypeError is raised

>>> matrix =  [
...    [1, 2, 3],
...    [4, 5,"rabbit"]
... ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

When a non-number is entered for div a TypeError is raised

>>> matrix = [
...    [1, 2, 3],
...    [4, 5, 6]
... ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, "rabbit"))
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: div must be a number

When div is 0 a ZeroDivisionError is raised.

>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
Traceback (most recent call last):
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
